## Project Description
- Air pollution is a growing concern in California, affecting both health and the environment.  
- This project aims to **predict daily Air Quality Index (AQI)** levels using weather and pollution data.  
- By analyzing temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant concentrations, we hope to find patterns that influence air quality.  
- Our goal is to build a simple machine-learning model to forecast AQI and help visualize how environmental factors impact air pollution.  
- The findings can support early warnings and promote awareness about air quality changes.


## Project Plan
- Collect and clean public air-quality and weather datasets (EPA AirNow / Kaggle).  
- Train simple models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to forecast AQI.  
- Evaluate performance and visualize results.

### Vince Lai â€“ Data Collection Plan
I will collect air quality and weather data using the **EPA AirNow API** and **Kaggle public datasets**.  
I will clean the data, remove missing values, and save the processed data into `.csv` format for training.  
This includes basic preprocessing and merging datasets into a single DataFrame for model input.

### Jjmaxxx â€“ Model Plan
I will develop a **neural network model using PyTorch** to predict AQI values from the processed data.  
I will experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and optimizers to improve accuracy.
