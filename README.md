## Project Description
We plan to predict daily Air Quality Index (AQI) levels in California using weather and pollutant data.  
Our goal is to explore relationships between temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pollution using machine-learning models.

## Project Plan
- Collect and clean public air-quality and weather datasets (EPA AirNow / Kaggle).  
- Train simple models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to forecast AQI.  
- Evaluate performance and visualize results.

### Vince Lai – Data Collection Plan
I will collect air quality and weather data using the **EPA AirNow API** and **Kaggle public datasets**.  
I will clean the data, remove missing values, and save the processed data into `.csv` format for training.  
This includes basic preprocessing and merging datasets into a single DataFrame for model input.

### Jjmaxxx – Model Plan
I will develop a **neural network model using PyTorch** to predict AQI values from the processed data.  
I will experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and optimizers to improve accuracy.
